## Environment Setup

This project uses secure configuration for Google Maps API keys. The implementation follows security best practices to prevent API keys from being committed to version control.

### Google Maps API Key Setup

#### Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Console**: Create a project and enable the Maps SDK for iOS and Android
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key with appropriate restrictions
3. **Billing**: Ensure billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Update Debug Configuration** (for local development):
   ```bash
   # Edit ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig
   # Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Google Maps API key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

2. **Update Release Configuration** (for production builds):
   ```bash
   # Edit ios/Flutter/Release.xcconfig
   # This references an environment variable for CI/CD
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=$(GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - The `ios/Runner/Info.plist` already contains the necessary configuration
   - The `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` reads the key from configuration
   - The `ios/.gitignore` prevents the Debug.xcconfig from being committed

#### Android Configuration

1. **Create/Update local.properties**:
   ```bash
   # Create android/local.properties (if it doesn't exist)
   # Add your Google Maps API key
   googleMapsApiKey=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

2. **Verify build.gradle.kts**:
   - The `android/app/build.gradle.kts` should reference the API key from local.properties
   - The `android/.gitignore` should exclude local.properties

#### Environment Variables for CI/CD

For production builds and CI/CD pipelines, set these environment variables:

```bash
# iOS
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE="your_api_key_here"

# Android
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

#### Security Features

âœ… **No Hardcoded Keys**: API keys are never committed to version control  
âœ… **Graceful Fallback**: App handles missing API keys gracefully  
âœ… **Environment Separation**: Different keys for debug vs release builds  
âœ… **CI/CD Ready**: Environment variables for automated builds  

#### Troubleshooting

**App shows "Maps Unavailable" message?**
- Check that your API key is correctly set in the configuration files
- Verify the API key has Maps SDK enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project

**Build fails with API key errors?**
- Verify the configuration files are properly formatted
- Check that environment variables are set for CI/CD builds
- Ensure the API key is not wrapped in quotes in configuration files

#### File Structure

```
ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ Flutter/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Debug.xcconfig          # Contains your API key (gitignored)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Debug.xcconfig.template # Template file (committed)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Release.xcconfig        # References environment variable
â”œâ”€â”€ Runner/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AppDelegate.swift       # Reads key from configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Info.plist             # Contains key configuration
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Excludes Debug.xcconfig

android/
â”œâ”€â”€ local.properties           # Contains your API key (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ app/build.gradle.kts      # References the API key
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                # Excludes local.properties
```

**Note**: The `Debug.xcconfig` and `local.properties` files are intentionally excluded from version control to protect your API keys.
