## Environment Setup

This project uses Google Maps for location features. To get it working locally:

### Quick Setup

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a project and enable Maps SDK for iOS and Android
   - Generate an API key

2. **iOS Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Edit ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig
   # Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

3. **Android Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create android/local.properties (if it doesn't exist)
   # Add your Google Maps API key
   googleMapsApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variable** (optional, for advanced users):
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE="your_api_key_here"
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

**Note**: The configuration files are already set up to read your API key. Just add your key and you're good to go!

**Security**: Your API keys are automatically excluded from version control to keep them safe.
